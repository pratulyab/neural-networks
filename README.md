# Neural Networks (NN)

1) NN from scratch using only NumPy
2) NN using Keras Sequential API

3) Overfitting in NN [Standardization, Dropout, Batch Normalization]
4) Transfer Learning in NN [MNIST, CIFAR-10]

5) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

6) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) [IMDB Sentiment Analysis]

7) Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) [Text Gen, Emoji Classification]
